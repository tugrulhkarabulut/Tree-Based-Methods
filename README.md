# Tree Based Methods In Machine Learning

This repo includes some implementations of tree models in Machine Learning such as Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine. 
They are implemented using numpy and the code is at an educational level rather than being highly efficient as some of the Machine Learning libraries' implementations.

Theoretical background of the algorithms are explained in the tree-based-methods.pdf file that's also present in this repo. You can read it if you
want to learn about them. Also, you can read in my [blog](https://tugrulhkarabulut.github.io/blog).
